# Process

## Scheduling and project management

#### üîÑ Cycles

Our team works in 3-week cycles. Each week starts on Monday.

The first two weeks of each cycle are focused on writing code. The third week is focused on deployment, feedback among the team, and planning the next cycle.

#### üï¥ Standups

We hold standups over Slack every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 8pm Pacific time.

Team members are expected to reply to the standup thread within twenty-four hours, so that everyone stays in sync.

#### üó£ Check-ins

Since we all work different hours, it's team tradition to post a message in Slack when you come online, for example:

> Hi everyone! I'm going to be working on the frontend until about 4PM.

This is done in order to encourage collaboration at times that multiple people are working on the same thing simultaneously.

## Workflows and procedures

#### üëÄ Code review

Each pull request opened against `master` must receive one approving review before being merged.

When a team lead reviews a pull request, they should do their best to provide high-level feedback about the architecture and approach of the code in question, as well as context around the change requests they make.

## ‚è± Expectations

Each participant has given a 5 hour per week commitment to the team. 

Generally this is taken at face value, but if team leaders feel that a member isn't delivering on their commitment, action may be taken to preserve team morale.
